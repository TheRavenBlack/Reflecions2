What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
- git creates empty repository
- creates its internal .git directory that contains repository metadata
- master branch is created and becomes active
- no files are commited by default
- files in current directory can be seen as untracked using git status command

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
- staging are is sort of a first buffer for changes done in working directory
- it allows to commit only part of the changes currently done
- working directory contains all the files and all the changes done on them, staging are holds only changes
  that will be (should be) commited with next commit command
