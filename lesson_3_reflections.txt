When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- in general when I want to share my work with other people. When there are multiple people collaborating
  on the same project - this will allow for all of them to have easy access to shared project
- it also servers as a backup, so it has meaning even if it is only a single person project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I might have my own changes that are not compatible with some other stuff that has been commited to the remote repo.
- in theory remote can also contain code/work that is not working and can mess up my work
