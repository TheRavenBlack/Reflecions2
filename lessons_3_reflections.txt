When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- in general when I want to share my work with other people. When there are multiple people collaborating
  on the same project - this will allow for all of them to have easy access to shared project
- it also servers as a backup, so it has meaning even if it is only a single person project
